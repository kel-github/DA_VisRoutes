\begin{abstract}
Given experience in cluttered but stable visual environments, our
eye-movements form stereotyped routines that sample task-relevant
locations, while not mixing-up routines between similar task-settings.
Both dopamine signalling and mindfulness have been posited as factors
that influence the formation of such routines, yet quantification of
their impact remains to be tested in healthy humans. Over two sessions,
participants searched through grids of doors to find hidden targets,
using a gaze-contingent display. Within each session, door scenes
appeared in either one of two colours, with each colour signalling a
differing set of likely target locations. We derived measures for how
well target locations were learned (accuracy), how routine were sets of
eye-movements (stereotypy), and the extent of intereference between the
two scenes (setting-accuracy). Participants completed two sessions,
where they were administered either levodopa (dopamine precursor) or
placebo (vitamin C), under double-blind counterbalanced conditions.
Dopamine and trait mindfulness (assessed by questionnaire) interacted to
influence both accuracy and stereotypy. Increasing dopamine improved
accuracy and reduced stereotypy for high mindfulness scorers, but
induced the opposite pattern for low mindfulness scorers. Dopamine also
disrupted setting-accuracy invariant to mindfulness. Our findings show
that mindfulness modulates the impact of dopamine on the accuracy and
stereotypy of eye-movement routines, whereas increasing dopamine
promotes interference between task-settings, regardless of mindfulness.
These findings provide a link between non-human and human models
regarding the influence of dopamine on the formation of task-relevant
eye-movement routines, and provide novel insights into behaviour-trait
factors that modulate the use of experience when building adaptive
repertoires.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Given stable environmental contingencies, it is adaptive for an organism
to develop routine ways of performing tasks requiring multiple
responses. Dopamine is assumed to play a key role in the neural
computations that underlie the formation of task routines. A large body
of evidence shows that dopaminergic midbrain neurons encode reward
prediction errors between stimulus-outcome associations (e.g. Schultz,
Apicella, and Ljungberg 1993; Hollerman and Schultz 1998; Waelti,
Dickinson, and Schultz 2001), and such errors are assumed to underpin
the teaching signal that computes the value of actions (Sutton and Barto
2018). A comparable signal generated in striatum marks the difference
between expected and actual saccadic sequence lengths used by macaques
to attain reward during visual search (Desrochers et al. 2010;
Desrochers, Amemori, and Graybiel 2015). This signal is assumed to
reflect a cost-benefit signal that computes the value of saccadic
routines. There also exists a large body of evidence from rodent and
macaque models suggesting that increased striatal dopamine availability
speeds the transition from goal-directed to habitual control of
behaviour (Harmer and Phillips 1998; Nelson and Killcross 2006; Nadel et
al. 2021, 2021), the latter of which is assumed to underlie performance
of routines (Dezfouli and Balleine 2012; Dezfouli, Lingawi, and Balleine
2014; Desrochers, Amemori, and Graybiel 2015; Graybiel and Grafton 2015;
Smith and Graybiel 2016). Although this evidence implicates dopamine in
the formation of task-relevant routines, whether dopamine availability
modulates the formation of saccadic routines in humans remains an open
question.

One way to address this question is to increase dopamine availability
via administration of levodopa, a precursor to dopamine. levodopa
administration in humans has been associated with increased striatal
activity in response to positive reward prediction errors, assessed
using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent BOLD responses (Pessiglione et
al. 2006), and with reduction of exploratory choices during instrumental
learning (Shohamy et al. 2006; Chakroun et al. 2020). This suggests that
levodopa may increase the perceived value of actions by inducing
optimistic evaluations of outcomes (FitzGerald, Dolan, and Friston
2015), possibly by disrupting feedback processing (Shohamy et al. 2006).
Elevating dopamine availability via levodopa may therefore have a
comparable impact on the cost-benefit computations driving the formation
of saccadic routines during visual search. Specifically, levodopa may
promote an optimistic evaluation of the performed sequence, increasing
the probability that it is adopted as a routine.

For task-oriented routines to be adaptive, it is also required that they
are not mixed-up between tasks, despite overlap in the situational cues
and actions that mark task environments. Here we define mix-ups as the
performing behaviours that are relevant for the task that is not
currently being performed, and we refer to this as task-interference.
More broadly, dopamine is assumed to play a modulatory role in the
activation of task-relevant behaviours in response to relevant
situational cues (Budzillo et al. 2017), as well as promoting the
formation of routines. Patients with Parkinson's Disease consistently
show deficits switching between simple sensorimotor tasks (R. Cools et
al. 2001; Wiecki and Frank 2010), as do healthy participants who have
been administered D2 antagonists (Mehta et al. 2004). Such findings have
been accounted for by assuming that decreased dopamine causes increased
uncertainty about the probability of being in a specific task-state
(Friston et al. 2012). These assumptions are based on evidence from
constrained tasks - i.e.~when single correct responses are required for
given stimuli. In contrast, saccadic routines are often formed from a
self-selected set of many possible eye-movements, and it is unclear
whether dopamine modulates switching between such routines. If a
modulation is observed, it is unclear whether the effect of increasing
dopamine is opposite to that of depleted dopamine, i.e.~does increasing
dopamine availability promote segregation of task routines? Or, does
increasing dopamine availability make it more difficult to switch
between routines, thereby increasing the probability of interference
between them?

A further but less frequently discussed component of the processes
underlying task routine learning and deployment, is the brain's
execution of task-relevant cues and actions. Presumably, the organism
that encodes an accurate representation of cues, actions and outcomes is
at an adaptive advantage when forming and executing task-relevant
routines. A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that mindfulness
may modulate such representations. Mindfulness has been defined as a
mental state that emphasises current sensory and internal inputs (Davids
1900; Shapiro et al. 2006), and as such is well-placed to promote
accurate task-representations. In support of this, mindfulness practice
has been associated with increased error monitoring during cognitively
challenging tasks (Andreu et al. 2017), and with greater sensitivity to
dynamics in operant reinforcement contingencies (Chen and Reed 2023;
Reed 2023). This suggests that increased mindfulness is associated with
better differentiation between current and previous contingencies of
reinforcement, potentially via improved focus on the former, thereby
reducing interference of the latter. Mindfulness has been shown to vary
at the trait level and is assessable using standardized questionnaires
(e.g.~Baer et al, (2006)).

What could be the modulatory influence of mindfulness on the formation
and deployment of task-relevant routines? The influence of mindfulness
on routine learning and task-switching may be opposing to the influence
of dopamine: individuals low in trait mindfulness are faster to exploit
sequential regularities in stimulus-response tasks (Stillman et al.
2014), and exploitation of such regularities are assumed to support
habitual responses (Dezfouli and Balleine 2012; Dezfouli, Lingawi, and
Balleine 2014). Mindfulness may also promote task-switching; higher
levels of trait mindfulness have been associated with decreased reliance
on past behaviours when stimuli are conserved across tasks that carry
different cognitive demands (Greenberg, Reiner, and Meiran 2012; Kuo and
Yeh 2015). Indeed, both the reinforcement learning (RL) and active
inference frameworks have been used to posit that mindfulness and
dopamine engage common mechanisms; increased mindfulness attenuates
striatal reward prediction errors (Kirk and Montague 2015; Kirk et al.
2019), possibly via greater regulation from stronger cortical
representations of subjective values and internal states (Kirk et al.
2014). In the active inference framework, both dopamine (Friston et al.
2012; FitzGerald, Dolan, and Friston 2015) and mindfulness (Laukkonen
and Slagter 2021; Giommi et al. 2023) are assumed to increase the
salience of task relevant cues, by increasing certainty of the estimates
of their value. Although increasing dopamine will increase the salience
of any cue present, mindfulness prioritises the salience of
goal-relevant cues. These theories therefore posit that mindfulness may
buffer against the influence of elevated dopamine, either by attenuating
elevated reward prediction errors, or by further amplifying the salience
of cues according to their goal-relevance. Despite these assumed common
mechanisms of influence, it remains to be quantitatively tested whether
mindfulness interacts with dopamine during the performance and execution
of task-relevant visual routines.

Using a novel protocol designed to test the formation and execution of
task-relevant saccadic routines in humans, we sought to test whether
administration of levodopa increased suboptimal routine formation, and
whether increased dopamine modulated interference between routines. We
further sought to test whether higher levels of trait mindfulness
provided a buffer against the impacts of increased dopamine
availability. To preview the results, levodopa decreased accuracy and
promoted routine formation in individuals with low trait-mindfulness,
whereas high trait-mindfulness was associated with the opposite pattern.
Regardless of mindfulness, dopamine increased task-interference.

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

A total of 40 participants (mean age: 24.5, sd: 5, 30 female, 10 male)
were recruited using the undergraduate and paid SONA pools administered
by the University of Queensland. All procedures were cleared by the
University of Queensland Human Research ethics committee
{[}2017/HE000847{]}, and were conducted in accordance with the National
Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research. Participants were over
18 years old, had no known neurological or psychiatric conditions
(assessed by self report), and no contraindications to levodopa, as
assessed by the levodopa safety screening questionnaire. Informed
consent was obtained at the start of the first session.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

Participants attended two sessions, spaced approximately 1 week apart.
After initial blood pressure (BP) and mood assessments (Bond and Lader
1974), participants received either placebo (vitamin C) or levodopa
(Madopar 125: 100 mg levodopa and 25 mg Benserazide Hydrochloride),
crushed and dispersed in orange juice, now referred to as the `placebo'
and `dopamine' sessions respectively. The solution was prepared by an
experimenter who did not administer the remaining experimental
procedures. This protocol was sufficient to achieve double blinding in
previous work (Chowdhury et al. 2012, 2013). Participants then completed
the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al. 2006) and the
Barratt Impulsivity Scale {[}BIS; Patton, Stanford, and Barratt
(1995){]}, as trait impulsivity scores are associated with midbrain
dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability (Buckholtz et al. 2010). Around 30
minutes after drug administration, participants completed a second BP
and mood rating assessment. Participants then completed the practice
stage of the task, so that the experimental stage began approximately 40
minutes after drug ingestion, within the window of peak plasma
availability (Contin and Martinelli 2010). At the end of the session,
participants completed the final BP and mood rating assessment and were
asked whether they thought they had been given the active or placebo
drug.

\hypertarget{apparatus}{%
\subsection{Apparatus}\label{apparatus}}

The experimental task was run with custom code\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kel-github/variability-decision-making}},
written using Matlab 2012b (32 bit) and Psychtoolbox v3.0.14, on a
Windows 7 (64-bit) on a Dell Precision T1700 desktop computer, displayed
using a ASUS VG248 monitor. Gaze coordinates (x, y) were sampled at 120
Hz using a monitor-mounted iView Red-m infrared eye tracker
(SensoMotoric Instruments GmbH, Teltow, Germany). Participants were
seated from the monitor at an approximate viewing distance of 57 cm, and
positioned on a chin-rest for the duration of the task.

\hypertarget{experimental-task}{%
\subsection{Experimental Task}\label{experimental-task}}

Each trial began with a fixation dot presented centrally on a grey
screen {[}RGB: 200 200 200{]}. Participants were instructed to fixate on
the dot to begin a trial. After 1000 ms of continuous correct fixation
samples (within 100 pixels of fixation), a square was presented that
comprised 18° visual angle along each length. The square could be one of
four possible colours {[}RGBs: 87, 208, 169; 267, 145, 52; 167, 162,
229; 239, 91, 158{]}. After 1000 ms, a 4 x 4 grid of smaller squares
appeared within the larger square, in a darker version of the background
colour ({[}RGB{]}-50). Each square comprised 2.6°. Participants were
instructed that the 4 x 4 grid represented doors, and that they were to
use their eyes to open the doors to find where the target was hiding.
Participants were instructed that they were to fixate on a single door
to open it. When participants had fixated on a door for over 300 ms, the
door either turned black {[}RGB: 50, 50, 50{]}, to denote the absence of
a target, or the target was displayed and the trial was terminated. If
the door had turned black, it returned to its previous colour as soon as
it was detected that the participant had moved their eyes from the door.
Targets were animal images drawn randomly on each trial from a pool of
100 images taken from the internet. The time at which the target was
available to be found varied from trial to trial, with the onset being
drawn from a uniform distribution between 500-2000 ms. Once the target
was available and the correct door selected, the target was displayed
for 750 ms. Upon termination of the trial, the grey screen and white
fixation cross were presented (see Fig \ref{fig:taskfig}A).

In each session, participants saw the display in two possible colours.
Participants were instructed that each colour represented a world, and
that the animals had different places they preferred to hide, depending
on the world they were in. There were four possible target locations
within each world, or from here on, each setting. For each setting, 1
door from each quadrant was selected as one of the 4 possible target
locations (see Fig \ref{fig:taskfig}B), with the constraint that target
locations could not overlap between settings. Thus each colour reflected
a setting in which participants could establish a set of task-relevant
eye-movements, i.e.~towards the 4 possible target locations. Note that
within each setting, the target was equally likely to appear behind any
one of the 4 target doors (p=.25) and would never appear behind the
remaining doors (p=0). Colour-target location mappings were
counterbalanced across participants, as was the assignment of colours to
sessions. Participants completed 80 trials in each setting. Eye-movement
calibration and validation was performed every 20 trials. Participants
were also shown the standard QWERTY keyboard and were instructed that
they could press `x' at any time to perform a new calibration and
validation if they felt that their eye-movements were no longer being
registered accurately.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{statistical-approach}{%
\subsection{Statistical Approach}\label{statistical-approach}}

The analysis was designed to assess how well participants learned the
target locations, the extent to which participants formed a routine for
door selections (how stereotypical they became in their order of
door-selections), and how well they disambiguated between settings. We
modelled how these elements of performance were modulated by the
dopamine and mindfulness factors. All custom analysis code is available
online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kel-github/DA_VisRoutes}}. The
analysis was performed using R and RStudio v2022.07.2 (RStudio Team
2020), and can be reproduced in the Neurodesk container environment
(Renton et al. 2022).

\hypertarget{data-cleaning}{%
\subsubsection{Data cleaning}\label{data-cleaning}}

We asserted that a door could not be selected twice consecutively, thus
any consecutive selections were classified as a single selection. As the
final door selection of every trial was fixed (i.e.~finding the target
location ends the trial), we removed the final selection from each trial
for the stereotypy (routine) analysis defined below. We excluded data
from one participant whose total number of door selections was greater
than 3 standard deviations from the mean across both sessions. The
remaining 39 datasets were retained for all of the analyses. Note that
this is more inclusive than our pre-registered plan for data
exclusions\footnote{\url{https://osf.io/2y6pk}}. Based on pilot data, we
had planned to exclude participants who scored \textless{} 65\% accuracy
over the course of a session. Analysis of the final sample suggested
that this was too stringent, as this resulted in the exclusion of 14 of
40 participants. We have not analysed the data with the exclusion of
these participants, owing to the large drop in statistical power for the
individual differences component of the analysis.

\hypertarget{accuracy}{%
\subsection{Accuracy}\label{accuracy}}

We first sought to determine the extent to which levodopa and
mindfulness influenced the learning of target locations (accuracy). Data
was grouped into blocks of 10 trials per setting, and grouped across
settings, resulting in 8 blocks of 20 trials. We computed for each block
the proportion of door selections that were target relevant (TR) given
the current setting (i.e.~the setting presented on trial t). We assessed
the influence of block, drug and mindfulness on accuracy using Bayesian
mixed-model logistic regression. Accuracy was assumed to be drawn from a
binomial distribution (1=target door, 0=non-target door). We then
estimated the probability of drawing a target-door from the total number
of door selections, using a logit link function to convert probabilities
to log-odds. Thus the resulting regression parameter values reflect
changes to the log-odds of accurate door selections.

For this and following analyses, we identified the model that best fit
the data, and made inference over the resulting parameters. We report
the 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of the parameter posteriors, and
assume a reliable effect when the 95\% CIs do not include zero. Models
were fit using the BRMS (Bürkner 2017) interface for Stan (Team, n.d.)
and RStan (Stan Development Team 2023). We used the default weakly
informative priors as specified in Burkner (2017). Specifically, fixed
and random effect \(\beta\) coefficients were given a flat prior,
intercept and standard deviations were assumed to be drawn from a
student's \(t\) distribution (df=1, location=0, scale=2.5), and the
LKJ-correlation prior with parameter \(\zeta\) \textgreater{} 0 was used
for the parameter covariance matrix. For each model, we checked for
parameter recovery using simulated data. Once fitted, we checked that
the residuals showed no signs of systematic error, that the chains had
converged, and that \(\hat{R}\) values were less than 1.01, as this
suggests that the model has converged.

To eschew an overly large model space, and in line with our
pre-registration, we first fit models that contained each possible
combination of the block and drug regressors (and associated random
effects), and found the best model using leave-one-out (LOO) cross
validation, as implemented in Vehtari et al., (2017). Rather than
re-fitting the model for every sub-sample, which is computationally
expensive, this algorithm instead computes analytically how the
predictions made by the model are influenced by each data point. The
relationship between this influence and the change in the posterior that
would occur as a consequence of holding out each data point can be used
to compute the expected log-pointwise predictive density (ELPD). This
quantifies the error that would occur in the prediction of each data
point, when that data point is withheld from the model fitting
procedure. The resulting ELPDs are then compared between models. We
report the ELPD difference between the winning model and the next best
models (a negative value indicates preference for the winning model). As
the ELPD is computed using each observed data point, it is possible to
estimate the standard error (SE) of the difference between models
(Vehtari et al, (2017)). We therefore also report the ratio of the ELPD
difference to the SE, as this provides a proxy for statistical
significant differences between models. (Note that in the
pre-registration document we had proposed to compare models using the
deviance information criterion (DIC). As LOO is more robust than DIC to
influential observations, and is readily implemented for use with BRMS
model objects, we opted to use LOO instead of DIC).

Upon identifying the best model, we then added the mindfulness
regressor, fitting all possible combinations, and once again selected
the best model. Last we controlled for trait impulsivity by adding BIS
scores as a main effect to the winning model. Note that in no cases did
adding BIS scores improve the model. The full set of model comparisons
are presented in the supplementary materials.

\hypertarget{setting-accuracy}{%
\subsection{Setting Accuracy}\label{setting-accuracy}}

We next sought to model the impact of levodopa and mindfulness on task
interference. To measure the extent of task interference, we computed a
measure of setting-accuracy. This measure indexes the total number of
door selections (n) that were appropriate for the colour setting
displayed on trial t (current setting, CS), relative to the number of
door selections that were appropriate for the setting not displayed on
trial t (i.e.~the other-setting from that session, OS):

\[
setting\mathrm{-}acc = \frac{\sum{CS_{n}}}{\sum{(CS_{n}, OS_{n})}}
\]

We modelled the influence of levodopa and mindfulness on
setting-accuracy using the Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression
approach described above (Note that in the pre-registration document we
had suggested to include a regressor for context. Visual inspection of
the data showed that setting-accuracy was highly comparable across
contexts {[}see Supplemental Figure 2{]}. We therefore opted to simplify
the model space and collapse over this factor).

\hypertarget{stereotypical-door-selections}{%
\subsection{Stereotypical door
selections}\label{stereotypical-door-selections}}

Next, we determined the extent to which door-selections became routine
over the course of the task - specifically, how much the order of door
selections increased in stereotypy, and whether dopamine and mindfulness
modulates the extent of stereotypy. Here we use stereotypy as a proxy
for routine formation, and we define stereotypy as the tendency to
choose doors in the same order, over trials (e.g. Desrochers, Amemori,
and Graybiel 2015).

In order to index stereotypy, we reasoned that stereotypy should result
in an increase in the probability of a subset of door transitions. This
stands in contrast to when making door selections in an exploratory, or
non-stereotyped way, where there should be an even representation of
door transition probabilities. Therefore, the transition probability
matrices of individuals engaged in more stereotypical door selections
should show higher variance than those who are not engaging in
stereotypical door selections. We computed trial level transition
probability matrices, and calculated the variance of each matrix.
Variances were then collapsed across settings and trials to form a
stereotypy score for each participant, session and block.\footnote{Note
  that we opted to index stereotypy using variance over transition
  probabilities as this measure captures consistent behaviours without
  over-penalizing slight variations between sequences. For example, the
  sequences x={[}1,2,3,4,5{]}, and y={[}1,2,4,3,5{]} share commonalities
  that are captured in a transition probability matrix that would not be
  captured by linear measures, such as comparing triplets between
  trials.}

The resulting stereotypy scores were subject to a comparable Bayesian
mixture modelling approach as described above with a few key
differences; the stereotypy scores were assumed to be drawn from a
skewed normal distribution \(\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma, \alpha)\) whose
mean (\(\mu\)) was defined by the regression parameters (the
distribution of stereotypy scores are presented in Supplemental Figure
3). \(\sigma\) was assumed to be drawn from a Student's t distribution
(df=3, location=0, scale=2.5), the skew parameter (\(\alpha\)) was
assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,4)\). The
remaining priors for the intercept, beta-coefficients and parameter
covariance matrix were defined in the same manner as for the accuracy
data models. As the log-log plot of variances vs block suggested a power
function, analysis was performed on the logged data. This ensured that
the relationship between block and variance values was best described by
a straight line. Identification of the winning model proceeded as
described for the accuracy data above.

\hypertarget{blinding-analyses}{%
\subsection{Blinding analyses}\label{blinding-analyses}}

To determine whether awareness of the dopamine intervention could have
contributed to the findings, the probability of participant ratings were
compared to the expected values assuming chance guessing, using a Chi
Square test. BP and mood ratings were each subject to a session
(dopamine vs placebo) x timepoint (pre-drug, pre-experiment,
post-experiment) Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA, implemented using the
BayesFactor package for R (Morey et al. 2023) using the default priors
(Rouder et al. 2012).

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

We investigated the impact of levodopa administration and trait
mindfulness on the learning of task-relevant behaviour sets, and on the
routine nature of their deployment. Participants opened doors to search
for targets in a gaze-contingent display. The colour of the display
signalled likely target locations, making some locations relevant for
only that colour. We assessed how well participants learned target
locations (accuracy), how routine was the order of door selections
across trials (stereotypy), and how well participants learned to
segregate task-routines (setting-accuracy). Overall, mindfulness and
dopamine interacted to influence the measures of accuracy and
stereotypy; dopamine increased accuracy and reduced stereotypy for high
mindfulness scorers, whereas dopamine decreased accuracy and increased
stereotypy for low mindfulness scorers. Dopamine decreased setting
accuracy independent to mindfulness scores.

First we sought the best model in order to make subsequent inference
over the parameters. In the first stage of model selection, the
experimental factors of block (10 successive trials from each context,
averaged across contexts), and drug (dopamine vs placebo) were used in a
logistic regression to model the probability of a target door selection.
We sought the combination of fixed and random effect factors that best
accounted for the data. The winning model contained fixed main effects
of block and drug. Although this model was only closely preferred to the
next most complex model that contained a block x drug interaction (ELPD
diff = -0.33, ELPD:SE = -0.57), it was strongly preferred to all other
models (min ELPD diff = -958.53, ELPD:SE = -8.65).

We next sought to determine whether adding mindfulness scores improved
the predictive accuracy of the model; the winning model contained an
additional main effect of mindfulness, as well as block x mindfulness
and drug x mindfulness interactions (ELPD diff to best model without
mindfulness = -3.12, ELPD:SE = -0.62). Therefore the winning model to
account for the data was:

\(\mathrm{\hat{y}} = \mathrm{block} + \mathrm{drug} + \mathrm{mind} + \mathrm{block*mind} + \mathrm{drug*mind} + \mathrm{(block:drug|sub)}\)

Adding BIS scores did not improve the predictive value of the model
(ELPD diff = -1.95, ELPD:SE = -3.77). Note that although we draw
inferences over parameters from the winning model, our inferences are
the same as if we had used the more complex model that includes the BIS
scores.

\hypertarget{the-effect-of-dopamine-and-mindfulness-on-accuracy}{%
\subsubsection{The effect of dopamine and mindfulness on
accuracy}\label{the-effect-of-dopamine-and-mindfulness-on-accuracy}}

Having established the best model to account for the data, we next
determined the influence of dopamine and mindfulness on accuracy by
making inference over the resulting parameters. Accuracy data plotted by
block x drug (dopamine vs placebo) are shown in Fig \ref{fig:accfig}A.
Accuracy improved over blocks, and there was a small main effect of
drug. These effects are described further below. However, critically,
mindfulness and dopamine interacted to influence accuracy. The drug x
mindfulness parameter differed reliably from zero (mean log odds =
-0.08, 95\% CI{[}-0.12, -0.03{]}, see Fig \ref{fig:accfig}E).

To investigate this interaction, we computed mean accuracy change due to
the drug session (\(\mu\) acc{[}dopamine - placebo{]}) for each
participant. Note that a positive score indicates that performance was
better in the dopamine session relative to placebo. Next we examined the
relationship between dopamine-induced accuracy changes and mindfulness
scores. As can be seen in Fig \ref{fig:accfig}B, there was a positive
relationship between mindfulness and the influence of drug on accuracy.
As mindfulness increased, so too did accuracy for the dopamine relative
to the placebo session. For a numeric example, those scoring in the
highest quartile showed mean accuracy scores of 0.47 (95\%CI{[}0.44,
0.50{]}) during the dopamine session, relative to mean accuracy scores
of 0.41 (95\% CI{[}0.38, 0.43{]}) during the placebo session.
Individuals scoring low on mindfulness numerically showed the opposite
pattern (dopamine mean accuracy = 0.43, 95\% CI{[}0.41, 0.45{]}, placebo
mean accuracy = 0.44, 95\%CI{[}0.43, 0.46{]}), note that Fig
\ref{fig:accfig}B shows the difference between these scores). Thus the
impact of dopamine on the establishment of task-relevant eye-movements
is dependent on the mindfulness state of the individual.

Participants learned the target door locations over the course of the
sessions, accuracy reliably increased over blocks. Mean accuracy in
block 1 was 0.34 (95\% CI{[}0.32, 0.37{]}), relative to a block 8 mean
of 0.50 (95\% CI{[}0.48, 0.53{]}). The model showed that the log-odds of
a target door selection increased over blocks by an average of = 0.15,
(95\% CI{[}0.08, 0.22, Fig \ref{fig:accfig}C, note that the model
parameters are defined in log-odds because we used logistic regression).
There was also the suggestion of a main effect of dopamine (mean log
odds = 0.08, 95\% CI{[}0.035, 0.13, Fig \ref{fig:accfig}D), however, the
impact of dopamine on accuracy is better explained by the drug x
mindfulness interaction Fig \ref{fig:accfig}E).

\subsection{Setting-Accuracy}\label{setting-accuracy-1}}

\hypertarget{model-selection-1}{%
\subsubsection{Model selection}\label{model-selection-1}}

We first identified the model that best accounted for the influence of
the experimental conditions on setting accuracy. Comparable to the
accuracy data, the best model contained fixed effects of block and drug,
with no interactions. Although this model was only closely preferred to
the next most complex model that contained a block x drug interaction
(ELPD diff = -0.66, ELPD:SE = -1.67), it was strongly preferred to all
other models (min ELPD diff = -553.79, ELPD:SE = -8.35).

Adding mindfulness scores improved the predictive accuracy of the model;
the winning model contained an additional main effect of mindfulness
(ELPD diff = -0.13, ELPD:SE = -0.12). Thus the winning model was:

\(\mathrm{\hat{y}} = \mathrm{block} + \mathrm{drug} + \mathrm{mind} + \mathrm{(block:drug|sub)}\)

Adding BIS scores did not improve the predictive value of the model
(ELPD diff = -0.02, ELPD:SE = -0.03). Note that although we draw
inferences over parameters from the winning model, our inferences are
the same as if we had used the more complex model that includes the BIS
scores.

\hypertarget{drug-and-not-mindfulness-impacts-setting-accuracy}{%
\subsubsection{Drug, and not mindfulness, impacts
setting-accuracy}\label{drug-and-not-mindfulness-impacts-setting-accuracy}}

We next determined the influence of dopamine and mindfulness on
setting-accuracy by making inference over the resulting model
parameters. Dopamine reduced setting accuracy; accuracy was on average
0.64 (95\% CI {[}0.63, 0.65{]}) for the dopamine session, and 0.66 (95\%
CI {[}0.65, 0.68{]}) for the placebo session (see Fig
\ref{fig:caccfig}A). The log-odds of selecting a setting-accurate target
door increased by a mean of 0.07 (95\% CI{[}0.01, 0.13, Fig
\ref{fig:caccfig}B) for the placebo session, relative to the dopamine
session. This suggests that dopamine caused interference between
settings.

Setting-accuracy improved over blocks; mean accuracy in block 1 was 0.59
(95\% CI{[}0.58, 0.61{]}), relative to block 8 (mean: 0.69, 95\%
CI{[}0.67, 0.71{]}). The model showed that the probability of selecting
a setting relevant target door increased by a mean log odds of 0.13
(95\% CI{[}0.07, 0.19) per block (Fig \ref{fig:caccfig}C). In contrast
to the overall accuracy data, the main effect of mindfulness was not a
sufficiently reliable predictor of setting-accuracy (mean log odds =
0.04, 95\% CI{[}-0.04, 0.18{]}).

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{setting-accuracy-control-analysis}{%
\paragraph{Setting-accuracy control
analysis}\label{setting-accuracy-control-analysis}}

Dopamine influences setting-accuracy, which indexes the likelihood of
door selections that are relevant for the current-setting, relative to
door selections that are relevant for the other-setting. As we exclude
door selections for locations that are never target relevant from the
computation of setting accuracy, it is important to verify that
setting-accuracy scores do indeed reflect interference between settings,
rather than a general task learning deficit. To address this in an
exploratory analysis, we reasoned that if setting-accuracy scores
reflected a general deficit, then `error' door selections should be
drawn randomly from not-target doors (other-setting = 4 \& neither = 8).
A general deficit interpretation suggests that other-setting selections
should be drawn from the total set (other-setting + neither) with \(p\)
= \(\overline{.333}\). If setting-accuracy scores do reflect the
presence of task-interference, then it would be likely that this error
would be more common than a random door selection, therefore
other-setting selections should occur at levels higher than chance. To
test this, we computed for each participant the probability of
other-setting selections, given the set of other-setting and neither
door selections (\(p_{os}\)), and performed a one-sided t-test, against
a null value of \(p\) = .333. (Note that we opted to use an NHST
approach as we had a point null hypothesis). The \(p_{os}\) data was
unlikely under the null hypothesis (mean = 0.37, 95\% CI{[}0.35,
0.39{]}, \(t\)(38) = 3.62, \(p\) = 0.0004. Therefore, we reject the
hypothesis that the the dopamine induced drop in setting-accuracy
reflects a general learning deficit.

\hypertarget{stereotypy-of-door-selections-routine}{%
\subsection{Stereotypy of door selections
(routine)}\label{stereotypy-of-door-selections-routine}}

\hypertarget{model-selection-2}{%
\subsubsection{Model selection}\label{model-selection-2}}

We first sought the model that best explained the stereotypy data using
the experimental predictors of block and drug. Note that we indexed
stereotypy using the variance of transition probability matrices, where
higher values indicates fewer likely transitions, and therefore higher
stereotypy. The winning model contained main fixed effects of block and
drug, and random effects for block x drug. Although this model was only
closely preferred to the next most complex model that contained a block
x drug interaction (ELPD diff = -0.26, ELPD:SE = -1.29), it was strongly
preferred to all other models (min ELPD diff = -130.14, ELPD:SE =
-7.71).

Adding mindfulness scores improved the ability of the model to account
for the stereotypy data. The winning model contained an additional main
effect of mindfulness and a drug x mindfulness interaction (ELPD diff =
-3.15, ELPD:SE = -0.92). The winning model was:

\(\mathrm{\hat{y}} = \mathrm{block} + \mathrm{drug} + \mathrm{mind} + \mathrm{drug*mind} + \mathrm{(block:drug|sub)}\)

Adding BIS scores did not improve the predictive accuracy of the model
(ELPD diff = -0.54, ELPD:SE = -1.41). Note that although we draw
inferences over parameters from the winning model, our inferences are
the same as if we had used the more complex model that includes the BIS
scores.

\hypertarget{the-impact-of-drug-and-mindfulness-on-stereotypy}{%
\subsubsection{The impact of drug and mindfulness on
stereotypy}\label{the-impact-of-drug-and-mindfulness-on-stereotypy}}

Stereotypy scores increased over blocks Fig \ref{fig:stereofig}A. Note
that this increase is also in part due to increases in accuracy; as
fewer doors are selected in error, the variance of the transition
probability matrices increases. We first discuss the key results, and
then inthe next section demonstrate their relationship to accuracy.
Critically, mindfulness and dopamine interacted to impact stereotypy; we
observed a reliable drug x mindfulness interaction (mean \(\beta\) =
0.11, 95\% CI{[}0.02, 0.21, Fig \ref{fig:stereofig}E). Mindfulness
scores modulated the impact of dopamine on stereotypy. As a numerical
example, those scoring in the highest quartile showed mean stereotypy
scores of -8.74 (95\%CI{[}-8.80, -8.68{]}) during the dopamine session,
relative to mean stereotypy scores of -8.68 (95\% CI{[}-8.74, -8.62{]})
during the placebo session. Individuals scoring low on mindfulness
(lowest quartile) showed the opposite pattern (dopamine mean stereotypy
= -8.69, 95\% CI{[}-8.75, -8.63{]}, placebo mean stereotypy = -8.72,
95\%CI{[}-8.78, -8.66{]}).

To visualise this interaction, we computed a mean variance change score
between drug sessions for each participant (\(\mu\)
stereotypy{[}dopamine - placebo{]}). Note that a positive score
indicates that performance was more stereotyped in the dopamine session
relative to placebo. As can be seen in Fig \ref{fig:stereofig}B, there
was a negative relationship between drug-induced stereotypy changes and
mindfulness. Specifically, higher mindfulness scorers showed lower
stereotypy in the dopamine session compared to the placebo session. Low
mindfulness scorers showed higher sterotypy in the dopamine session
compared to the placebo session. Thus the impact of dopamine on the
formation of eye-movement routines is dependent on the mindfulness state
of the individual.

Participants developed more stereotypical routines over the course of
the experiment, there was a clear main effect of block (mean increase
per block: \(\beta\) = 0.32, 95\% CI{[}0.20, 0.43, Fig
\ref{fig:stereofig}C). In line with the interaction of drug x
mindfulness reported above, the main effect of mindfulness suggested a
negative relationship with stereotypy (mindfulness mean \(\beta\) =
-0.15, 95\% CI{[}-0.26, -0.05, Fig \ref{fig:stereofig}D). Overall,
higher mindfulness scores predicted less stereotypy in door-selection
patterns relative to low mindfulness scores.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{on-the-relationship-between-accuracy-and-stereotypy}{%
\paragraph{On the relationship between accuracy and
stereotypy}\label{on-the-relationship-between-accuracy-and-stereotypy}}

Accuracy and stereotypy showed opposing relationships with mindfulness
and dopamine. Higher mindfulness scores were associated with
dopamine-induced accuracy increases, and stereotypy decreases, relative
to placebo. Individuals scoring low on mindfulness showed a deleterious
influence of dopamine on accuracy, coupled with increased stereotypy,
relative to placebo. As accuracy and stereotypy are possibly, but not
necessarily related, we next sought to ensure that the observed
influences of dopamine and mindfulness on stereotypy was not driven by
accuracy, using an exploratory analyses. We reasoned that such a pattern
of results could be observed if the measures of accuracy and stereotypy
reflected a direct trade off; i.e.~as accuracy goes up, stereotypy goes
down. A correlation analysis ruled out this possibility. We computed
mean accuracy and stereotypy scores for each participant, collapsing
across all experimental factors, and found that accuracy and stereotypy
were positively related (\(r\)(37) = 0.81, \(p\) = 3.51e-10).

Next, to rule out the contribution of accuracy to the stereotypy
results, we added mean accuracy, computed for each block and drug
condition, as a regressor to the winning model. Adding accuracy as a
regressor both clearly improved the predictive accuracy of the model
(ELPD diff = -110.26, ELPD:SE = -6.12), and served to increase certainty
in the interactive influence of mindfulness and drug on stereotypy
scores. Specifically, the estimated influence of the interaction
increased from \(\beta\) = 0.11 to \(\beta\) = 0.22 (95\% CI{[}0.14,
0.29{]}). Note that the pattern of remaining results were also
consistent between the two models. Therefore, the data support the
notion that mindfulness and dopamine interact to differently influence
accuracy and stereotypy when participants perform task-relevant saccadic
routines. Indeed, this data suggest that mindfulness and dopamine
interacted to produce more erroneous routines. To visualise this, Fig
\ref{fig:trajecfig} shows example door selections from two participants,
one randomly selected from the lowest quartile of mindfulness scorers
(top row), and one selected from the highest quartile of mindfulness
scorers (bottom row). As can be seen, the low mindfulness scorer had
adopted a routine that resulted in more erroneous door selections than
the high mindfulness scorer. The low mindfulness scorer appears to have
developed a suboptimal task strategy of trying all doors, regardless of
context.

\hypertarget{blinding-check}{%
\subsection{Blinding check}\label{blinding-check}}

Next we checked if participants knew whether they had received levodopa
or placebo across the two sessions. Participants were asked to report at
the end of each session whether they thought they had received levodopa
or placebo. Participant responses were coded as either correct for both
sessions (cc: observed N = 7), correct for one session and incorrect for
the other (ci: N = 11), or incorrect for both sessions (ii: N = 8). The
probability of the observed guesses was not statistically unlikely given
the null distribution of chance performance (the null hypothesis
specified \(p\)= .25, .5, .25 for cc, ci, ii respectively, \(\chi^2\)(2,
26) = 0.69, \(p\) =0.71). Note that we were unable to include all the
participants in this analysis owing to missing data. Specifically, due
to a miscommunication in the research team, the blinding check questions
contained `Don't know' as a possible response, for which we are unable
to generate a null hypothesis. We therefore only include participants
who made a guess using the levodopa and placebo options across both
sessions.

\hypertarget{mood-and-blood-pressure}{%
\subsection{Mood and blood pressure}\label{mood-and-blood-pressure}}

We also sought to determine whether dopamine influenced physiological
factors such as mood and blood pressure. For mood, the winning model
contained a main effect of time-point and no other fixed effects. This
model was preferred relative to next best model, which contained an
additional main effect of drug (BF = 3.76, ±2.14\%) and was
substantially preferred over the null random intercept model (BF =
514549 ±1.23\%).

Mean blood pressure was computed using the formula: Mean blood volume
pulse (BVP) = diastolic blood pressure (DBP) + 1/3 {[}systolic blood
pressure (SBP) -- DBP{]}. For mean BVP, the winning model contained main
effects of both time-point and drug. This model was barely preferred to
the next best model which contained a time-point x drug interaction (BF
= 1.7 ±5.69\%), but was strongly preferred to the random intercept model
(BF = 5011975 ±3.76\%). Overall, mean BVP was lower in the levodopa
session (mean = 2.181.511261, 95\% CI{[}80.3, 82.8{]}), relative to
placebo (mean = 84.5, 95\% CI{[}83.5, 2.185.504042{]}).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

We investigated the impact of levodopa administration and trait
mindfulness on the learning of task-relevant behaviour sets, and on the
routine nature of their deployment. Participants opened doors to search
for targets in a gaze-contingent display. The colour of the display
signalled likely target locations, making some locations relevant for
only that colour. We assessed how well participants learned target
locations (accuracy), how routine was the order of door selections
across trials (stereotypy), and how well participants learned to
segregate task-routines (setting-accuracy). levodopa impacted accuracy,
stereotypy and setting-accuracy, but in the case of the former two, this
impact was modulated by trait mindfulness. High trait mindfulness
corresponded to increased accuracy and decreased stereotypy, for
levodopa relative to placebo, whereas low trait mindfulness was
associated with decreased accuracy and increased stereotypy (for
levodopa relative to placebo). These results quantify, for the first
time, that increasing systemic dopamine availability induces a trade-off
between accuracy and stereotypy that is modulated by trait-mindfulness,
and that increased dopamine availability increases routine confusion.
These findings carry implications for our theoretical understanding of
how the brain establishes and switches between task-relevant behavioural
routines, which we outline below.

The current findings offer insight into the relationship between
dopamine and mindfulness. Dopamine and mindfulness have been indirectly
related in both the reinforcement learning (RL) (Kirk et al. 2014, 2019)
and active inference frameworks (Friston et al. 2012; FitzGerald, Dolan,
and Friston 2015; Laukkonen and Slagter 2021; Giommi et al. 2023), yet
there exists no other study to-date that assesses their joint impact on
behaviour. Here we find that levodopa and mindfulness jointly modulate
learning and stereotypy, with levodopa yielding conditions of decreased
accuracy and increased stereotypy in low trait mindfulness scorers. We
hypothesise that low mindfulness results in poorer sensory-action
representations which renders the individual more susceptible to error
when estimating the reward value of actions, which is compounded by
over-optimistic estimations induced by elevated dopamine availability.
The result is a failure to differentiate between the actions that do and
do not lead to reward, and an increased probability of reliance on past
behaviours. This could be manifest via impoverished top-down, cortical
regulation of positive prediction errors in striatum (Kirk et al. 2014),
as has been predicted within an RL framework. The same result could also
be accounted for by a decrease in certainty regarding sensory prediction
errors occurring with low mindfulness (Laukkonen and Slagter 2021;
Giommi et al. 2023), in tandem with dopamine inducing inflated certainty
regarding reward outcomes (FitzGerald, Dolan, and Friston 2015), as has
been suggested via the active inference framework.

Note that the two accounts predict comparable outcomes so we are unable
to differentiate between them with the current data. However, the
current findings do constrain these accounts regarding the extent of
overlap between the actions of dopamine availability and mindfulness.
Increased dopamine availability increased routine confusion, regardless
of trait mindfulness. Therefore, there are limitations to the modulatory
influence of mindfulness on the actions of dopamine. The establishment
and maintenance of a task-set is assumed to reflect a superordinate
representation of a goal and the set of actions required to attain that
goal (Schumacher and Hazeltine 2016; Desrochers et al. 2016; Sutton and
Barto 2018; Vaidya et al. 2021; Lee, Hazeltine, and Jiang 2022). The
current data suggest that while dopamine and trait mindfulness can
jointly modulate the learning and execution of subordinate
representations, i.e.~the set of actions used, mindfulness does not
modulate the impact of dopamine on superordinate task representations,
at least under the current task conditions. Future work should determine
whether these observed limits in the modulatory influence of mindfulness
are due to a limited locus of effect, or are due to increased
vulnerability to the impacts of dopamine at superordinate levels of
representation.

The finding that levodopa increased interference between settings
extends previous work showing that dopamine impacts switching between
simple sensorimotor tasks that require only one response (R. Cools et
al. 2001; Mehta et al. 2004; Wiecki and Frank 2010). Collectively, these
findings point to a U-shaped function linking dopamine levels and
task-switching impairments, in that depleted and inflated levels of
dopamine result in poorer task switching. This observation informs
theoretical accounts of the relationship between dopamine and an agent's
ability to infer the current task state, which have previously only
considered the impacts of depleted dopamine (Friston et al. 2012). These
findings do support previously postulated hypotheses that there should
be a U shaped relationship between dopamine levels and task-performance,
that is in part dependent on task demands (R. Cools and D'Esposito
2011). As the currently studied behaviours are more complex than the
constrained sensorimotor tasks that are typically used in task-switching
studies, future work should verify whether levodopa administration
comparably impacts task-switching in simple sensorimotor tasks, and
whether depleted dopamine impacts switching between tasks requiring
multiple responses. This will determine whether the relationship between
dopamine and task-switching is comparable across tasks or depends upon
task demands.

To minimise task interference, an agent must maintain a representation
of the actions required to achieve the task goal, and must associate
this representation to the correct task cues. We found that levodopa
increased the probability that actions from a non-relevant task-set
would be selected during current task performance invariant to
mindfulness, whereas the probability that an erroneous action was
selected varied across individuals according to their trait mindfulness.
Therefore, the most consistent locus of task-set confusion is between
actions that have been credited as successful in either task-context.
What remains to be determined is whether levodopa caused
task-interference, or attenuated the ability to associate successful
actions with the appropriate situational cues. If the latter is true,
then levodopa would have caused individuals to learn one task, that did
not incorporate the colour cue as a relevant disambiguating signal. We
seek to arbitrate between these possibilities in future work.

In contrast to expectations, levodopa led to an overall reduction in
stereotypy in door selections, suggesting that increased dopamine
availability reduces the probability of forming a routine when
performing multiple responses. This is in contrast to previous findings
showing that increased dopamine speeds the transition to habit formation
(Harmer and Phillips 1998; Nelson and Killcross 2006; Nadel et al. 2021,
2021). As with task-switching studies, such findings are largely based
on rodent models using tasks comprising one or two stimulus-response
associations. Our findings show that in the case of sets of
task-relevant saccades, increasing dopamine does not necessarily lead to
increased habit formation. Moreover, levodopa did not improve accuracy
overall, suggesting that our results cannot be solely attributed to
levodopa increasing model-based control (Wunderlich, Smittenaar, and
Dolan 2012; Kroemer et al. 2019; Deserno et al. 2021), or adjusting the
balance between exploitation and exploration (Kayser et al. 2015;
Chakroun et al. 2020).

What then is the influence of dopamine on the cost/benefit computations
that drive routine formation? In accordance with previous work with
non-human primates (Desrochers et al. 2010; Desrochers, Amemori, and
Graybiel 2015), the current data suggest that dopamine is a modulator of
the computations that drive routines in humans. However, the current
data also show that the modulatory influence of dopamine is dependent on
the behaviour-trait state of the individual. Specifically, increased
dopamine appears to drive individuals low in mindfulness towards a
stereotypical solution that is suboptimal in terms of accuracy,
suggesting a poor evaluation of sequence costs relative to benefits. In
contrast, individuals high in trait mindfulness show increased accuracy
but reduced stereotypy, suggesting an appropriate crediting of
successful actions, but also suggesting either some volatility in their
execution, or better learning that the probability of a target was
uniform across target-relevant locations. While the current data
demonstrate the applicability of dopamine signalling to the computations
that underlie the formation of routines, the data also show further work
is required to determine the internal state variables that determine
whether increased dopamine availability will have a positive or negative
impact on performance.

The current work is not without limitations. A difference was found in
mean BVP between the levodopa and placebo sessions, suggesting more
general physiological differences between the sessions. However, the
effect of levodopa on blood-pressure is well characterised, and depends
partly on the effective dose (dose per kilogram, Goldberg et al
(Goldberg and Whitsett 1971)). It is unlikely that low and high
mindfulness individuals differed systematically in terms of effective
dose. Participants were also not able to detect whether they had
received levodopa or placebo above what would be expected by chance.
Therefore, the physiological changes appeared to not be subjectively
detectable, lowering the likelihood that discernible subjective
differences impacted the results. Note that although the power of our
blinding test was lowered owing to missing data, the remaining N was
comparable to sample sizes from previous investigations into the impact
of dopaminergic pharmacological intervention on decision-making, that
employed comparable blinding tests (Leow et al. 2023; Pine et al. 2010;
Wunderlich, Smittenaar, and Dolan 2012; Vo et al. 2016; Vo, Seergobin,
and MacDonald 2018).

Although accuracy and stereotypy theoretically need not be correlated,
we did find a moderate positive correlation between the two measures.
Critically, the modulatory influence of mindfulness and dopamine on
stereotypy was found to be larger after accounting for accuracy.
Furthermore, accuracy and stereotypy were at antithesis to each other
with regard to the demonstrated impacts of mindfulness and levodopa.
Nonetheless, further work should be done to confirm the dissociable
impact of dopamine and mindfulness on these two aspects of performance.
We shall seek to achieve this in future studies by controlling task
parameters to maintain accuracy, while examining modulations to
stereotypy.

It could also be anticipated that participants who received levodopa
administration in the first session may show carry-over effects to the
subsequent session, e.g.~levodopa may modulate the extent to which the
individual learns that there are two settings, and this may affect how
they approach the task in the second placebo session. Our double-blind,
counter balanced design renders it unlikely that the current findings
are due to session order effects, and our statistical power is such that
we are not well placed to detect them in the current data. However, it
would be very interesting to determine how levodopa influences carryover
of task formation and routine execution to new situations. Future work
should include conditions that allow us to tease out order effects, for
example by including DA-DA and placebo-placebo conditions.

We sought to determine the modulatory influence of dopamine availability
and trait-mindfulness on the formation and deployment of task-relevant
saccadic routines. We found evidence for theoretical assertions that
dopamine and mindfulness share overlap in their locus of influence, but
also demonstrated boundaries in that overlap. Mindfulness modulated the
impact of dopamine on task-learning and routine development, with
levodopa administration resulting in low mindfulness individuals being
more likely to show impaired learning and increased stereotypy.
Invariant to trait-mindfulness, levodopa increased the likelihood of
task-interference between settings, suggesting that dopamine either
hampers the binding of actions to situational cues, or promotes
confusion between task-states. Collectively, these data suggest that the
fidelity of situational representations interact with reinforcement
learning systems to drive the formation of behavioural routines.
