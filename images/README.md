Experimental Task. A) A single trial where participants use their eyes to open doors to locate a target. B) Contexts and sessions: in each session, participants are exposed to two colour contexts each with 4 unique and equiprobable target locations. Colours and target locations were counterbalanced across participants and sessions. In each session, Levodopa (DA) or placebo (off)* is administered under double blind conditions.

*I need to change 'off' to 'p'

Fig. A) Showing accuracy (dots) and model predictions (dotted lines) for the DA (l) and placebo (p) conditions* across blocks. Error bars reflect within subject SEM. The winning model showed a main effect of drug, a main effect of block, and a mindfulness (m) x drug interaction. B) Showing the interaction between mindfulness and drug. To depict the interaction, difference scores were computed between the two drug conditions ($acc_{DA} - acc_{placebo}$) and averaged across blocks, per participant. The resulting scores are plotted against mindfulness scores (normalised). Participants scoring low on mindfulness were less accurate in the DA relative to the placebo session, whereas participants scoring high on mindfulness showed the opposite pattern. C) Posterior estimates for the main effect of drug, D) posterior estimates for the mindfulness x drug interaction, and E) posterior estimates for the main effect of block.

*I need to change 'l' to 'DA' and 'p' can remain as 'p'.
